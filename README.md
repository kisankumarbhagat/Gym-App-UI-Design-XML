# **Gym App UI Design (XML)**

This repository contains XML layout files for key screens of a gym management Android app, including **Splash Screen**, **Profile Screen**, and **ViewHolder**. It also includes gym-related images (logos, icons) in the `drawable` folder.

## **Screens Included**

- **Splash Screen**: Introductory screen shown when the app starts.
- **Profile Screen**: Displays user info, progress, and membership details.
- **ViewHolder**: Custom view for displaying lists of gym-related content (e.g., workouts, exercises).

## **Drawable Resources**

The `res/drawable` folder includes XML resources for UI elements:

- **Backgrounds**: (e.g., `blue_bg.xml`) for setting background colors or images.
- **Custom Views**: (e.g., `edittext.xml`) for custom styles of `EditText` or other UI elements.

These XML files define the visual styles and can be referenced in your layout files to create a consistent look and feel across the app.

## **Usage**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kisankumarbhagat/Gym-App-UI-Design-XML-.git
